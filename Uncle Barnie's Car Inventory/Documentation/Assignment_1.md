> A programmer is the enablement of a business case.  Therefore, a programmer must wear many hats.

#### The First Hat:

As the quote above aludes to we have a lot to learn as a programmer.  The first step is to gather requirements from the business user to generate a solution that has the features and scalability of this solution.

#### Requirements Gathering
  Gathering requirements seems like an easy thing to do however, let me ask you this.  Have you ever had a conversation with someone and they ask you to do something and you do it exactly like they asked but it was still wrong? So did every programmer that has gathered requirements.  
  
  There are three rules:
  
  1: Expect miscommunication
  
  2: Define core functionality AKA: I need to be able to do X,Y,Z for this application to be used for it's intended purpose
  
  3: Allow scope creep within reason.  Do not cram too much functionality that you miss the deadline.
  
  
  Ask questions often, engage with the business side often and have functionality to show!
  
With that, I would like to move onto the back story of Uncle Barnie...

#### Uncle Barnie
He seems to be a typical used-car salesman however he has high goals for his established business.  His old windows 98 pc coughs dust as it chugs through the inventory he has.  However, trying to add your car to the recent list caused his authiritis to burn in his thumb.  He starts talking about how he bought this software back in the day for over 20 grand and you being a new member of the IT field decided to ask a life changing question that will soon change Uncle Barnie's business forever.  
"If you add 10k to my trade-in I can build you a better solution than what you have now."  
"Deal." 

"Oh shit...I didn't think he'd really say he'd do it!"

So you go through the motions of him showing you the old application. 

It currently has the functionality to:
##### Car Management
- Add a new car
- Display information about the car in detail
- Edit information for a car
##### Car Sales
- add options, discounts and tax for specified state
- display final total of car with sub totals
- Receive payments on car if financed

##### Reporting + Accounting
- If the car is sold it can be added to his sales ledger
- View the balance of his sales ledger
- View current financed cars
  - View Address
  - View Payment Ammount
  - View Payment Date
  - View if past due or not
  
 "So can you do it?"
 "Sure I can, this will take me a while but I can make this and let's meet in two weeks to discuss if there are any changes"
 "Alright, deal.  Now do you want insurance on your lightbulbs?  Ya' know, they always burn out when you least expect it"
 "Uh...No thank you."
